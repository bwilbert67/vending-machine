## Module 1 Capstone - Vending Machine Software

This my first Java project ever! It includes the code for a command line vending machine. Shoutout to my partner Noah! 

Technologies 
   - Object Oriented Java 
      - Custom Built Classes
      - Exceptions 
      - System.in Scanner 
      - Reading from a file
      - Unit Tests with JUnit

Fuctionality: 
The program allows the user to do the following 
   - "Stock" the vending machine by reading from a CSV file 
   - Enter "virtual" money into the vending machine 
   - View the contents of the vending machine, its code, and its price
   - Give the user feedback based on the item that they bought (Ex: "crunch crunch crunch!" if they bought chips)
   - Provide some "pizzaz" (font styles) to the CLI with ANSI styling 
   - Throw special error messages if users give poor input (Example: if the user tries to enter in a money amount of $0.0001, it reminds them to enter a penny or greater)
   
  Improvements => What I would do with more time 
   - Add a log file that tracks what was bought so that the owner could keep track of inverntory easily.
